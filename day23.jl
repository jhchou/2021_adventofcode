# Rules
# - Amber 1 energy per step; Bronze 10; Copper 100; Desert 1000
# - will never stop on the space immediately outside any room (positions 3,5,7,9 in row 1)
# - will never move into a room unless destination AND no amphipods there not their own destination
# - once stops in hallway, will stay until it can move into its room
#
# Input
#   #############
#   #...........#    --> hallway 11 columns
#   ###D#A#C#C###    --> positions 3, 5, 7, 9 -- off limits unless room valid to enter
#     #D#A#B#B#
#     #########
#
# String encoding: 11 characters of hallways followed by sets of 4 characters for rooms
# - Empty spaces '9'
# - Amphipods: A '0', B '1', C '2', D '3'
#   - energy = 10^type
#   - goal column for room = 2*type + 3
#
# Costs
# - ?for heuristic -- account for only movement in first row?
# - ?start room to hallway above start room: depends on input?
# - hallway above destination to goal room: 3 * (1 + 10 + 100 + 1000) = 3333
